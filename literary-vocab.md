## Description

Collection of English vocabulary I acquired reading 19th century and even older works. Many of these words are still in use. Others are legacy. Some are *extremely* archaic (ie Middle Ages). 

## Background

Pragmatically speaking, you should not explore such a list but for pure entertainment. 

I accumulate and even appeal to some of the words here probably because I have issues. Well, I also fancy a mild linguistic curiosity in ancient constructions: finding common patterns in words, tracing origins to other Latin/Greek derived languages.

But otherwise, it attains none but purely academic benefit. On the contrary, use of such words only challenges communication and distances your audience. 

(Michel de Montaigne emphasized this same notion in a 16th century essay of his [not much of the philosophical varies throughout the centuries] except that, naturally, my translation was written in what has now become an incredibly archaic language.)
